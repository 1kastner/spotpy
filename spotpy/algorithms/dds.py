        Method:
        "The DDS algorithm is a novel and simple stochastic single-solution based heuristic global search
        algorithm that was developed for the purpose of finding good global solutions
        (as opposed to globally optimal solutions) within a specified maximum function (or model) evaluation limit."
        (Page 3)

        The DDS algorithm is a simple greedy algorithm, always using the best solution (min or max) from the current
        point of view. This may not lead to the global optimization.
